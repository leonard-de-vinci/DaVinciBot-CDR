JSON exchanged strings are kept small to avoid sending and receiving useless bytes of data.
This document explains how data is transfered between the embedded device and the python process.

In every message, there is the `c` parameter which is the command.
 - 0 is for the device identification. If the device receives this command, it will send back the command 0 with its deviceId in the `v` parameter.
 - 1 is for ping. The device will wait for a ping after each subscribe and after its initialization.
 - 2 is for sending and receiving data. Each message contains 2 or 3 additionals parameters described below.

Parameters for command 2 (data):
 - If t is 255, then it's a subscribe command from the device. The crc24-ed data is sent in the `s` parameter.
   The python host will then send a ping back. If this response is not received within 500ms, the subscribe message is sent again.
 - If t is 0-1-2-3, then it's a data message. The `s` parameter contains the crc24-ed topic (s for subject) and `v` contains the value.

List of data types:
 0  int
 1  String
 2  float
 3  double


TODO:
 - Add a special command for the emergency stop.
